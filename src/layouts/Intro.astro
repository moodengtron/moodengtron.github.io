          Moo Deng is a female pygmy hippopotamus born on July 10, 2024, at the Khao Kheow Open Zoo in Sriracha,
          Thailand. She has quickly become an internet sensation due to her adorable appearance and playful antics. Moo
          Deng was named after a pork dish. She is the offspring of Jonah and Tony, with siblings also named after pork
          dishes, reflecting a playful naming trend at the zoo. Moo Deng's life, from her birth to her daily activities,
          is meticulously documented and shared, making her a significant figure in the realm of internet animal
          celebrities. The TRON token, MOODENG is the first token on the TRON network in her name, and this is a site
